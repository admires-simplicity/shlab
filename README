finished shell from cs:app3e shell lab. lab files are in "lab" directory. tsh.c is shell source.

most code in tsh.c is starter code that is given out with the lab.

I just had to implement eval, builtin_cmd, waitfg, do_bgfg, and the sigal handlers, and a couple helper functions.

I call printf in my signal handers, which is not safe.
